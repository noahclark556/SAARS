SAARS
Security Assessment and Reporting System
Users will join teams, each team will contain assessments from all recent security tests.
Assesments can be accessed by all members but permissions will be in place for certain aspects.
Users will be able to input basic information, ability to expand using AI will be available but
the format will have to be consistent.
Database structure will be similar to CIDDMS. Maybe use firebase instead?

Fix overflow in pdf, need algo for that. Unicode shit is weird when copy pasting, who knows, maybe arm arch error.
Add rest of report elements to pdf.
